# Sieve of Eratosthenes

Sieve of Eratosthenes implemented in MIPS assembly language.

## Prerequisites

To run the program, you will need the MARS IDE for programming in MIPS assembly which can be found here: https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/

### Running the program

1. Once you have cloned this project (```git clone https://github.com/njohnson-oss/sieve-of-eratosthenes```), open the primes.asm file in the MARS IDE.
2. Under MARS settings panel, check "assemble all files in directory" and "Initialize program counter to global 'main' if defined".
3. Under MARS run panel, click assemble. Then click go also under the run panel.
4. The program is now running. You can interact with it via the Run I/O tab at the bottom
